    <h1>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h1>
    <h2>The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems</h2>
    <p><em>By Martin Kleppmann</em> <span class="source-ref"></span></p>

    <h2>About the Book</h2>
    <p>
        Data is central to many system design challenges today, including scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability <span class="source-ref"></span>. This book helps navigate the diverse landscape of technologies for processing and storing data by examining the pros and cons of various tools like relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream/batch processors, and message brokers <span class="source-ref"></span>. It focuses on the fundamental principles that remain constant even as software changes, enabling software engineers and architects to apply these ideas effectively in modern applications <span class="source-ref"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The book aims to help you make informed decisions about system architecture, understand trade-offs, learn from major online services, and grasp the underlying distributed systems research <span class="source-ref"></span>. It delves into the internals of data systems, their key algorithms, principles, and trade-offs, providing intuition for their behavior and enabling better design decisions <span class="source-ref"></span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Should Read This Book? <span class="source-ref"></span></h2>
    <p>
        This book is for software engineers, software architects, and technical managers involved in developing applications with server-side data storage or processing <span class="source-ref"></span>. It's particularly relevant if you make architectural decisions, choose tools, or want a deeper understanding of the systems you use <span class="source-ref"></span>. Some familiarity with web applications, relational databases, and SQL is assumed <span class="source-ref"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>This book is valuable if you want to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn how to build scalable, highly available, and robust data systems <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
        <li>Make systems easier to maintain long-term <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
        <li>Understand the internals of major online services and database technologies <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Concepts Covered</h2>
    <p>The book focuses on three core concerns for data systems <span class="source-ref"></span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Systems should work correctly even in the face of hardware faults, software errors, and human mistakes <span class="source-ref"></span>. Topics include fault tolerance and resilience <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Systems should have reasonable ways to deal with growth in data volume, traffic, or complexity <span class="source-ref"></span>. This involves describing load and performance, including concepts like latency percentiles and throughput <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Systems should be easy for different people to work on productively over time <span class="source-ref"></span>. This includes operability, simplicity (managing complexity), and evolvability (ease of making changes) <span class="source-ref"></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Book Structure <span class="source-ref"></span></h2>
